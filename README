These settings are for the version of Skeinforge bundled
with ReplicatorG 0017. All of my profiles use a feedrate
of 255 PWM as my motor is broken and doesn't extrude at
lower power settings.

Commit messages are usually of the format:
       F(feed rate) WT(width/thickness) L(layer height)

This profile is currently best for printing low-detail,
large-volume objects. The layer height is low and the feed
rate is high. Walls and surfaces are water-tight. Holes,
circles and towers currently are very poor.

c u p c a k e - s l o w - l o r e s

This profile is best for objects with significant
complexity: holes are dealt with okay and towers are
slightly blobby but not bad. Circles are excellent with
this profile.
