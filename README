This profile is currently best for printing low-detail,
large-volume objects. The layer height is low and the feed
rate is high. Walls and surfaces are water-tight. Holes,
circles and towers currently are very poor.

This profile is best for objects with significant
complexity: holes are dealt with okay and towers are
slightly blobby but not bad. Circles are excellent with
this profile.
